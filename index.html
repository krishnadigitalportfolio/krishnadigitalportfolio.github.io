    <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
    <p> I like to play basketball, write music and write poems. In addition, I play piano and I do Certificate of Merit, a piano test that I take annually. These are some of the activities that I participate in outside of school. Currently, I am engaged in writing lyrics for a few of my new songs that I have made and I just finished the season with the Rhoades School basketball team (who are imsl champions).
