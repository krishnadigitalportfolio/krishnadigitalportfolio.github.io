<h3> My SMART Goal</h3>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
<p>My SMART goal at the beginning of the year was to be an overall better writer.</p>
<p> I feel like throughout the course of the year, I have made small improvements on assignments such as quick writes on SeeSaw, but on my big essays I need to focus more on answering the question. I think some ways I can work on this are providing more analysis and showing that I truly understand what I am writing. Typically I can see errors if I re-re-read my essay so doing that can elp me as well. Throughout the rest of the year, I need to write a lot more. Whether this comes out in the form of poems/short stories I just need to write.</p>  
<p></p>
<h3> My Strength</h3> 
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">    
<p> My strength was having organized notes and being able to reflect on my notes in the evening. I think I need to use my notes a bit more while doing my homework, because it shows in my tests when I have good notes (i.e. 4.5-4.9 Math Test, Chapter 6 Math Test, Literature quiz Odyssey 1-17). I think my srength hasn't wavered too much throughout the course of the year. I typically take good notes, but it shows when I don't reflect in the evening and don't really use it in my homework. I use my notes on homework for math and my notes are extremely useful for assignments such as quickwrites and quizzes in humanities.</p>
   <h3> My Stretch</h3> 
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
<p> My stretch was improving on being concise in my writing and providing more analysis in my writing. I feel like my stretch has improved on quick writes, but on my bigger essays such as my Scarlet Letter final I feel like I strayed off at one part and didn't really answer the prompt to the best of my capabilities. Other than that, I haven't written any other essays. I think I need to focus more on my essays and I need to focus a bit more on analyzing and answering the question.</p>        
        <p></p>
        <h3>Mid-Year Reflection Questions</h3>
    <p>I have a pretty broad friend group and I typically hang out with the same people at lunch every day. Kids are typically pretty easily accepted. I have been hanging out with this group for a couple of years though, so that's probably part of it. I feel like I am a better leader in smaller groups where it's not as hard to communicate my thoughts with other people. I also think there aren't really too many situations where I am seen as a bigger leader. Not many people see me as a leader, I guess. I always complete my work on time, but there have been a couple situations in which I have turned my annotations in 1 day late. I think I need to do a bit better in terms of managing my time, and especially now that I am taking piano more seriously it's especially important that I know how to deal with my academic and musical workload while not doing the bare minimum, but doing a good job in both.</p>
